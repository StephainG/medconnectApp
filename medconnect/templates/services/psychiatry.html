                <p style="line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 32px;">Psychiatry is a medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis, 
                    treatment, and prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. 
                    Our psychiatrists are highly trained medical doctors who specialize in 
                    understanding the complex interplay between biology, psychology, 
                    and social factors that contribute to mental health conditions.
